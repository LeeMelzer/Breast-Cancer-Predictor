# Logistic Regression: Breast Cancer Prediction

First attempt at machine learning. The model was trained to accurately predict if a breast cancer is malignant or benign. Training of this model used logistic regression and data from a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. 
The dataset used for training can be found at the UCI Machine Learning Repository here: [DataSet](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

Tools used include:
  - JupyterLab
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - SciKit-Learn

The model was found to have an accuracy of 98% (see image below).
